## About Me
My name is Zachary Collier, but everyone just calls me Zack.

I am currently enrolled in Keyin College's Software Development program. I have always been interested in software, so it felt like a perfect fit. I have also completed the Chemical Process Engineering Technology program at the College of the North Atlantic.

I am a gamer at heart, and I like to take care of my stuff. I also like to experiment occasionally, whether that be through poking around at my computer or through physical artistry.

I currently know (and am still learning) some amount of Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Also learning some GDScript in my off-time. Hoping to learn a few other languages in the future.
